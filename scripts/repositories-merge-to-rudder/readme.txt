We want to merge all project with the same lifecycle than Rudder into
the main "Rudder" repository. 

The first step is to merge all scala projects: 
- https://issues.rudder.io/issues/14147

The `merge-scala-repo.sh` is the script which was used to merge all
scala project into Rudder. It shows how one can merge a remote project
into an other, without loosing history.
