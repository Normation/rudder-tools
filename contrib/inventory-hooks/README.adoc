= Inventory hooks library

This folder contains example inventory extension hooks for Rudder.
Feel free to contribute yours! Hooks can add information about anything
and be implemented in any language (shell, python, perl, ...),
as long as they can be useful for others.

== Installation and usage

To setup an inventory hook, follow the https://docs.rudder.io/reference/current/usage/advanced_node_management.html#extend-nodes-inventory[documentation in the manual].

To create groups based on extended inventory properties, read about the different cases in
https://docs.rudder.io/reference/5.0/usage/node_management.html#search-nodes-properties-json-path[the nodes properties usage documentation].
