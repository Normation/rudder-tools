# There is no real check on those features by openssl except basicConstraints
# We don't use critical not pathlen to avoid incompatibilities with future checks

# keyCertSign: certificate signature
# cRLSign: crl signature
# digitalSignature: file signature (not used for crl, may be used for DHE)
# dataEncipherment: file encryption (usualy no used, we cipher a temporary key instead)
# keyEncipherment: key exchange (for tls with RSA)
# keyAgreement: key exchange (for tls with DHE)
