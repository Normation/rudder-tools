= Change logs for Rudder 2.8

Rudder 2.8 has reached End of Life the in November 2013. This branch is
codenamed ``Patrol boat''.

This page provides a summary of changes for each version. Previous beta
and rc versions are listed below for convenience.

*​Main new features in Rudder 2.8:*

* Configuration for change messages and change requests (validation
workflow) can now be done inside the web interface (Administration ->
Settings)
* Relay servers are now fully operational, and a simple process has been
put into place to make a regular node into a relay for promises, reports
and inventories. See
http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-doc-2.8/rudder-doc.html#relay-servers.
* HTTP/S is now enabled and configured by default (using a self-signed
certificate)
* Change Requests (validation workflow) can now be managed through REST
API. See
http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-api-doc/#api-Change_Requests.
* Significant performance improvements (up to 30% speed increase) on
displaying pages with reports in the web interface (``Rules'' and ``Node
details'' pages)
* The rudder-agent now uses CFEngine 3.5
* Android system is now supported in all Techniques
* Directive details display has been improved, so you can focus on
configuration settings

A blog post about all these features is available here:
http://blog.normation.com/en/2013/11/20/rudder-2-8/

*Installing, upgrading and testing*

Documentation to Install and Upgrade is available online. The Download
page sums up URLs. We also recommend using the Rudder Vagrant config if
you want a quick and easy way to get an installation for testing.

*Operating systems supported*

This version provides packages for these operating systems:

* Rudder server: *Debian 5, Debian 6, Debian 7, RHEL/CentOS 6, SLES 11,

This is a bug fix release in the 2.8 series and all installations of
2.8.* should be upgraded when possible. This version is not yet marked
``stable'', since it has not yet proven itself to be reliable on
production systems over a period of several months. The current
``stable'' release is still 2.6.*.

When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested,
and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment. To be
declared ``stable'' we prefer to wait until a version has been available
and running in production for several months. However, since new 2.9.*
versions has been released, we expect that new version to be declared
stable very soon.
