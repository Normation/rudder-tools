== Rudder 6.1.10 (2021-03-18)

=== Release Notes

==== Change of behavior for empty technique parameters

Previously, when adding a new parameter to a technique in the technique editor, all directives based on this technique
were still valid and used an empty value for the new parameter. This leads to unexpected behaviors, and makes adding
parameters to techniques potentially dangerous.

To prevent this type of problems (in the scope of a patch release) we had to totally prevent passing empty parameters to techniques from the technique editor. This makes missing parameters a policy generation error, allowing to safely provide
them to directives after modifying the source technique.

This may break existing directives that rely on an expression which evaluates to an empty value, like a property containing an empty string, or a property value with an empty default.
In this case, you can pass a specific value like
`None` or a space char to indicate an empty value, and modify the technique to handle the special case
as a workaround.

We will work on a better solution in a future version, allowing to make the difference between new parameters and
intentionally blank ones.

(https://issues.rudder.io/issues/18832[#18832])

==== Policy server reload

We fixed a known issue is the way we reload the policy server (the service that distributes policies to Unix systems).

Previously, when adding a node or modifying allowed networks, a configuration reload was triggered, but it was only effective when the service became idle. On loaded Rudder servers or relays, this may totally prevent service reload, and thus
prevent the new nodes from connecting.

We replaced the reload by a graceful restart mechanism which takes effect immediately. This should not
cause any visible changes, except that two `cf-serverd` processes might be running at the same time (on
handling existing connections until completion, one handling the new ones).

(https://issues.rudder.io/issues/18893[#18893])

==== Other important fixes

* We fixed lock issues in Rudder server logic, this should make Rudder safer and faster and thus we recommend all users to update to 6.2.3 (https://issues.rudder.io/issues/18983[#18983])
* In rare cases, the agent inventory processes could pile up, exhausting resources of the machine. This has been fixed, another important reason to update to 6.2.3 (https://issues.rudder.io/issues/18832[#18832])
* OOM exception now stops Rudder correctly with information logs either in rudder-jetty service or in webapp logs, but some JVM, especially old Java 8, still don't log anything (https://issues.rudder.io/issues/18955[#18955]). As a consequence, Rudder now requires at least OpenJDK 1.8.0-92.

=== Release notes

Special thanks go out to the following individuals who invested time, patience, testing, patches or bug reports to make this version of Rudder better:

* Florian Heigl

This is a bug fix release in the 6.1 series and therefore all installations of 6.1.x should be upgraded when possible. When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested, and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment.

and rc versions are listed below for convenience.
