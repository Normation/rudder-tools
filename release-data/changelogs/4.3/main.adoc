= Change logs for Rudder 4.3

Rudder 4.3 has reached public End of Life the 11th January 2019.
It is currently maintained as part of extended support included in
https://www.normation.com/en/rudder/subscription/[Rudder subscription].

This page provides a summary of changes for each version. Previous beta
and rc versions are listed below for convenience.

*Main new features in Rudder 4.3:*

* *Technique Parameters:* You can now add parameters to your Techniques
created with the Technique editor. The value of theses parameters will
be set in Directives, making your Techniques much more versatile and
expressive and giving you access to feature that were only available to
classic Techniques.
* *Multi version/mode Directives:* You can now apply Directives with
different versions and different policy mode _on the same node_. This
allow easy migration (to a new version, from Audit to Enforce) that was
previously impossible.
* *Authorization system for API accounts:* Choose between read-only or
full access. A plugin will be available soon in order to allow you more
finely grained authorization.
* *Node properties from inventory:* Node properties can be automatically
provided by the inventory data from the node.
* *Node lifecycle:* You can define a state for each Node managed by
Rudder (provisioning, pending removal, disabled etc.). This can be used
to build groups and apply configuration according to the Node current
state. Also disabled Nodes are not counted in compliance reports, so you
are not bothered by offline Nodes when checking compliance.
* *Group based on Groups*: You can now define that a Group should
contain the Nodes of another Group, making it easier to manage a complex
set of Nodes.
* *Graphs on the dashboard are now clickable*: You can access the list
of nodes in a category by clicking on parts of the graphs.
* *Import/Export of techniques in the Technique Editor*: There is now a
button to export or import a technique in the Technique Editor, allowing
sharing techniques easily. Be careful, this import/export only works
between servers running the same Rudder version.
* *IPv6 support by default:* Rudder is now completely compatible with
IPv6 on the agent side as well as server side.
* *Hooks on Techniques:* When you write a Technique by hand, you can add
pre- and post- hooks in it that will be executed once per Technique,
even if you applied it in several directives.
* *Use system Perl:* On recent systems, rudder-agent does not embed Perl
anymore, so it uses an up to date version of Perl more integrated to
your system. All the needed dependencies are either declared (for the
common ones) or still embedded. On a side note, it makes it easier to
build a rudder-agent package (which size goes down from 12MB to 4MB!).
* *Rudder agent services based on systemd:* On systemd based os, we
switched from SysV init system to systemd, to make rudder-agent more
integrated to your system.
* *Time all actions made by the agent:* A new option (-T) added to
``rudder agent'' command line, to display how long an action took and
find what makes a run slow.
* *Renaming of all generic methods:* We changed for a clearer and more
logic name scheme in all our generic methods in the Technique editor.
* *Simplified logger for Techniques:* We changed the way we do reporting
for Techniques from Technique editor with a much simpler way, which
should be faster and also fix some reporting issues (ie: when you use
variables in your reports).
* *Plenty of library updates / cleaning / architecture changes*: Either
on web app or in rudder-agent we upgraded some dependencies, refactored
some code, to provide you a more secure, maintainable and faster Rudder.

*Installing, upgrading and testing*

* Install docs:
https://www.rudder-project.org/doc-4.3/_installation.html
* Upgrade docs:
https://www.rudder-project.org/doc-4.3/_upgrade_rudder.html
* Download links:

=== Release notes

Special thanks go out to the following individuals who invested time,
patience, testing, patches or bug reports to make this version of Rudder
better:

* Janos Mattyasovszky
* Alexander Brunhirl
* Florian Heigl
* Dennis Cabooter

This is a bug fix release in the 4.3 series and therefore all
installations of 4.3.x should be upgraded when possible. When we release
a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested, and we consider
the release enterprise-ready for deployment.
