= Change logs for Rudder 4.0

Rudder 4.0 has reached End of Life the 30th June 2017.

This page provides a summary of changes for each version. Previous beta

* Policy can be applied in ``Audit mode'', which only checks
configuration and does not enforce it, on a global, per-node or
per-directive basis
* Global redesign of web interface
* Files from shared folder can be selected using a file browser
* Agents can be remotely started using API (wrapper for ``rudder remote
run'' on the CLI)
* Settings API
* Rudder agent status command
* Performance improved (compliance, policy generation are faster)
* New file copy protocol

A blog post explaining these features is available here:
