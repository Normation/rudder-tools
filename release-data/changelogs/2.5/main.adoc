=== Release notes

This is a release candidate for Rudder 2.5.0, fixing all known bugs
encountered in 2.5.0~beta1. We still do encourage testing, and welcome
all and any feedback! This release is not yet production ready, and
production use is at your own risk.

A final release of Rudder 2.5.0 can be expected within roughly a week,
which will be encouraged for production use. This version will not,
however, be marked ``stable'' (unlike previous final versions), until it
has been available and proven to be reliable on production systems.
2.4.0 will remain the ``stable'' until then.
