Special thanks go out to the following individuals who invested time,
patience, testing, patches or bug reports to make this version of Rudder
better:

This is a bug fix release in the 5.0 series and therefore all
installations of 5.0.x should be upgraded when possible. When we release
a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested, and we consider
the release enterprise-ready for deployment.
