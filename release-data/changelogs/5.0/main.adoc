= Change logs for Rudder 5.0

Rudder 5.0 is currently a maintained version of Rudder.

This page provides a summary of changes for each version. Previous beta
and rc versions are listed below for convenience.

*Warning*: The following features are now provided as plugins and no
more available as part of default Rudder installation starting from 5.0:

* LDAP-based authentication
* Relay servers
* Changes validation workflow (change requests)

If you were using them, upgrade will disable them and you will have to
install the plugin. Read the http://rudder.io/plugins[plugins page on
our website] for more information.

The initial RUDDER model consisting of a single software block which
includes all features, thus imposing a greater and greater complexity on
all of our users, has reached its limits. We have now reached a
sufficient understanding of the domain, its challenges, and the way
RUDDER is used, to make us realize that this all-in-one model is not, or
is no longer, the best suited.

_New plugin ecosystem_: Version 5.0 introduces a plugin ecosystem that
gathers RUDDER’s most specific features. This way, only essential
features have to be installed by default and advanced features can be
used on a case by case basis. So what is essential and what is not? The
basic rule is that the essential experience must contain the features
used by 80% or more of users, whatever the scale of use. In other words,
we keep as core features everything that delivers on RUDDER’s initial
promise: enabling users to continuously audit and enforce configurations
with an easy to use webapp providing visual reporting. The remaining 20%
solve needs that are no less important, only less common (PDF compliance
reports, UI branding, scale-out relay servers, validation workflow…). To
know everything about the impact of this evolution, you can read the
detailed dedicated article:

https://www.rudder.io/en/blog/2018/09/26/rudder-5-new-modular-version-thanks-ecosystem-plugins/[RUDDER 5 – a new modular version, thanks to an ecosystem of plugins]

_Integration_: We provide integration with third party tools as plugins,
making RUDDER more integrated with tools like Ansible, Centreon, Zabbix,
GLPI or Vault. Except for a few (ie. managing AIX and Windows host),
plugins are open source and source code is available in the
https://github.com/normation/rudder-plugins/[rudder-plugins repository].

_New documentation_: Welcome to our brand new documentation website
https://docs.rudder.io[docs.rudder.io]! Beyond its fresh look (both on
the online website and in the embedded version), this new documentation
includes updated content and new resources, like a ``getting started''
guide and examples of use-cases.

_System API_: We built a new REST API that allows to manage some
advanced settings and perform maintenance operations in RUDDER, like
triggering policy generations, updating dynamic groups and managing
report archives. This was previously available in the now deprecated
https://docs.rudder.io/history/4.3/rest-api.html#rest-api[V1 API] which
will be removed in the next major version (5.1).

_Debugging information script_: We created a script to gather basic
information about a RUDDER setup when you want to debug or understand
RUDDER’s behavior. This script fetches log files and executes various
commands, either to get information from databases or directly from the
system (package versions, etc)

_Automatic Technique upgrade_: Techniques provided with RUDDER can now
be automatically upgraded when you update RUDDER. This process used to
be manual because you might have modified the base Technique Library and
we thought you may want to have more control about the content of your
Technique Library. But it appears that this process was forgotten by a
majority of our users and so many bug fixes and new versions were not
available after an upgrade. By default this feature is enabled on new
RUDDER 5.0 installations but is disabled on upgrades from older
versions, to prevent any accidental damage.

_Support policy_: Our general policy is to maintain major releases until
3 months after the next major version is released to give some time for
upgrading. The ESR tag was previously given to major releases that were
maintained 6 months after the next ESR version was announced. Rudder 4.1
is the last ESR release. For a slower major upgrade pace, Rudder
subscription provides long-term maintenance up to 24 months after
release (depending on the subscription level) for Rudder versions. Read
the
https://docs.rudder.io/reference/5.0/installation/versions.html[dedicated page]
for more information.

_Packaging_: _Relay server support is now part of an open-source
plugin_, pre-compiled packages are available as part of the Rudder
subscription.

The agent package is now more modular: instead of embedding all
dependencies, we are using system libraries on maintained operating
systems, to allow for a better system integration. As a consequence, the
experimental rudder-agent-thin (which had this exact goal) package is
not built anymore.

_New repositories_: https://repository.rudder.io/ We are using new
repositories for versions starting from 5.0. We also provide all
previous releases in these new repos. We improved our build system,
files hierarchy, and added more gpg signatures on distributed files
(Rudder sources, etc.)

== Known issues in Rudder 5.0.0 to 5.0.2

=== Communication between agents built with 1.1.0 vs. 1.0.x openssl versions

We have found a communication problem between some versions of rudder
agent and server due to a bug in OpenSSL library.

The problem occurs when a client (resp. server) using OpenSSL 1.0 tries
to communicate with a server (resp. client) using OpenSSL 1.1.0. It is
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/7134[corrected] in newly
released OpenSSL 1.1.1. The Rudder corresponding bug is
https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/13690[traced on Rudder bug
tracker].

Rudder versions from 5.0.0 to 5.0.2 on Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, and SLES
15 use OpenSSL 1.1.0. Any previous version of Rudder on these OS or any
version of Rudder in any other OS use OpenSSL 1.0. If you have in your
environment a Rudder server in one group and agents in the other group,
these agents won’t be able to communicate with the server any more.

The most likely case where it could happen is if you upgrade a Rudder
server on Ubuntu 18.04 or on Debian 9 from version 4.3 to 5.0. In such a
case, a partial workaround is to also upgrade Debian 9/Ubuntu 18.04
agents to Rudder 5.0, but agents in other OS will still be impacted by
the communication problem. A safer and simpler solution, if available,
is to delay such on upgrade until a patch is available.

We are working on the patch to replace the buggy OpenSSL 1.1.0 and we
will release a new version of Rudder 5.0 with it as soon as possible.

We are sorry for any inconvenience resulting from this problem. If you
need more information or help, please don’t hesitate to contact us by
email or other means of communication like
https://gitter.im/normation/rudder[gitter] or irc (#rudder on freenode).
