This is a maintenance release, part of the ``old latest'' 2.9 branch. It
is recommended to upgrade all pre-2.10 installations to 2.10 as soon as
possible to enjoy the latest features and improvements of a more mature
and stable version.

When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested,
and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment. This
release is marked as `old-stable' since a subsequent release (branch
2.10) has proven itself to be `stable'. `Old-stable' also means that
this release has been assigned an `end-of-life' date, in this case 30th
June 2014. See our FAQ for details, on
https://www.rudder-project.org/site/documentation/faq/#what_is_the_versioning_policy.

This is a bug fix release in the 2.9 series and all installations of
2.9.x should be upgraded when possible. This version is not yet marked
``stable'', since it has not yet proven itself to be reliable on
production systems over a period of several months. The current
``stable'' release is still 2.6.*.

When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested,
and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment. To be
declared ``stable'' we prefer to wait until a version has been available
and running in production for several months. As such, we expect version
2.9 of Rudder to be declared stable very soon.

=== Release notes

Special thanks go out to the following individuals who invested time,
patience, testing, patches or bug reports to make this version of Rudder
better:

* Dennis Cabooter
* Yvan Masson
* Olivier Mauras
* Christophe Nowicki
* Joachim Setzer
* Daniel Stan
* Alex Tkachenko

This is a bug fix release in the 2.9 series and all installations of
2.9.x should be upgraded when possible. This version is not yet marked
``stable'', since it has not yet proven itself to be reliable on
production systems over a period of several months. The current
``stable'' release is still 2.6.*.

When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested,
and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment. To be
declared ``stable'' we prefer to wait until a version has been available
and running in production for several months. As such, we expect version
2.9 of Rudder to be declared stable very soon.
