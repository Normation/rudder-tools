=== Release Note

This software is in beta status and has several known bugs (particularly
https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/11027[#11027],
https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/10961[#10961],
https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/10990[#10990] and
https://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/issues/11051[#11051]). You should
hence not use it in production. However, we do encourage testing, and
welcome all and any feedback!

To be able to finish the installation (on ubuntu), after
`apt-get install rudder-server-root` fails, you will need to:

* workaround #10990

....
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/
git init
git add .
git commit -q -m "initial commit"
....

* workaround #11051

....
touch /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-share-acl-24.conf /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-share-acl.conf
cp /opt/rudder/etc/ssl/rudder.crt /opt/rudder/etc/ssl/ca.cert
....

* finish installation:

....
apt-get install -f
....

* reset git repos (because it is in a bad state)

....
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -q -m "initial commit"
....
