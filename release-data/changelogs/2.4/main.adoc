This is a maintenance release, part of the ``old stable'' 2.4 branch. It
is recommended to upgrade all pre-2.6 installations to 2.6 as soon as
possible to enjoy the latest features and improvements of a more mature
and stable version.

When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested,
and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment. This
release is marked as `old-stable' since a subsequent release (branch
2.6) has proven itself to be `stable'. `Old-stable' also means that this
release has been assigned an `end-of-life' date, in this case January
2014. See our FAQ for details, on
http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/FAQ/#What_is_the_versioning_policy_63.

** Technique ``Enforce a file content'': Option to choose if the file to
edit should be created or not if it doesn’t already exist (#2945)
** Technique ``Enforce a file content'': line replacement didn’t work
if the replacement was empty and only one Directive from this Technique
was applied on a node (#2819)

This can be worked around by downloading and installing a nightly build
of the rudder-techniques package, from our nightly build APT repo
(http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-2.4-nightly/) or RPM repo
(http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-2.4-nightly/).

=== Release notes

This version of Rudder is in beta status. While we have tested it
thoroughly and believe it to be free of any majors bugs, use on
production systems is not encouraged at this time and is at your own
risk. We are however running it on our internal production system with
success.

(visible in Event Logs and as a git commit message)

change validation
* Groups and Directives can now be cloned
* Many UI improvements

=== Release notes

Please note that this beta3 version contains significantly more new
features that the beta1 and beta2 versions (available on
rudder-project.org but not officially announced). This decision was made
to include features from another branch that were reaching maturity
almost at the same time as this release was prepared. This decision is
the cause for the delay in this release, and can be seen as uncommon,
but we are confident about the quality of this release.

This version of Rudder is in beta status. While we have tested it
thoroughly and believe it to be free of any majors bugs, use on
production systems is not encouraged at this time and is at your own
risk. We are however running it on our internal production system with
success.
