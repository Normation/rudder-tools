== 🛠️ Under the hood

=== New rudder package command

The plugin manager has been rewritten and its command-line interface is now simpler
and more user-friendly.
All commands taking plugin names now accept multiple values.

The new interface is not compatible with the earlier one and the arguments and options
were reworked. For most used commands the changes are:

* `rudder package install-file <file>` -> `rudder package install <file>`
* `rudder package plugin enable/disable <plugin>` -> `rudder package enable/disable <plugin>`
* `rudder package check-connection` -> `rudder package update --check`

You can still use the previous implementation with `RUDDER_PKG_COMPAT=1 rudder package ...`, but it will
be removed in an upcoming release.
