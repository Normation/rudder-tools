This is a bug fix release in the 3.1 series and therefore all
installations of 3.1 should be upgraded when possible. This version is
not yet marked ``stable'', since it has not yet proven itself to be
reliable on production systems over a period of several months. The
current ``esr'' release is still 2.11.*. When we release a new version
of Rudder, it needs to be thoroughly tested, and we consider the release
enterprise-ready for deployment only after it has been proven to run in
production reliably for several months.

This is a bug fix release in the 3.1 series and therefore all
installations of 3.1 should be upgraded when possible. This version is
not yet marked ``stable'', since it has not yet proven itself to be
reliable on production systems over a period of several months. The

enterprise-ready for deployment only after it has been proven to run in
production reliably for several months.
