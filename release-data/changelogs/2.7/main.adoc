This is a bug fix release in the 2.7 series and all installations of
2.7.x should be upgraded when possible. This version is not yet marked
``stable'', since it has not yet proven itself to be reliable on
production systems over a period of several months. The current
``stable'' release is still 2.6.*.

When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested,
and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment. To be
declared ``stable'' we prefer to wait until a version has been available
and running in production for several months. However, since new 2.9.*
versions has been released, we expect that new version to be declared
stable very soon.

=== Release notes

This is a bug fix release in the 2.7 series and all installations of
2.7.x should be upgraded when possible. We have tested it thoroughly on
production systems and believe it to be free of any major bugs. This
version is not marked ``stable'', since it has not proven to be reliable
on production systems over time yet. The current ``stable'' release is
still 2.6.*.
